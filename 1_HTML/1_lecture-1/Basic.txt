div -> The <div> HTML element is the generic container for flow content. 
        It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using 
        CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like
        Flexbox is applied to its parent element)

<a></a> The <a> HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a 
        hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, 
        or anything else a URL can address.
        <a href="https://example.com">Website</a>
